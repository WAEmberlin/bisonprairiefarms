      <h2>Childcare</h2>
      <p>
        At Bison Prairie Farms, we believe that the great outdoors is the best classroom for young minds. Nestled within trees and surrounded by open spaces and wildlife, our program offers a nurturing environment where children connect with nature and develop a deep sense of curiosity, wonder, and respect for the world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our nature-based early learning curriculum encourages exploration, hands-on learning, and creativity through outdoor activities like gardening, hiking, building, and animal care. Children engage with natural elements like mud, water, plants, and wildlife, fostering physical, emotional, and cognitive development in ways that are meaningful and fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through unstructured play and guided discovery, we promote skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and environmental stewardship. Whether it’s collecting leaves, building a fort, or watching the growth of a planted seed, every day offers new opportunities for growth and exploration.
        </p>
      <p>
        We create a warm, supportive community where children learn to respect each other and the environment.
        </p>

    <img src="images/KylieKilmerPortrait.jpg" alt="A portrait photo of Kylie Kilmer" class="about-photo">
    <p><strong>Kylie Kilmer, MS.Ed <br>
      Owner / Lead Instructor<br>
      TSVI/COMS</strong></p>
    <p>I have a Bachelor’s Degree in recreation therapy and a Master’s Degree in special education. As a former special education teacher, I have 7 years of experience working with children of all ages and abilities. Education was great, but I needed to make a change to staying at home after having our children. This program allows me to get back to what I loved about teaching — the kids!</p>
    <p>I am married to Austin, who works in the technology industry and is a part-time law enforcement officer. Together, we have 3 children as part of a blended family.</p>
    <p>When our child struggled with the transition to a Kindergarten classroom, we took the leap into homeschooling. After hearing story after story of families with the same experience, I decided to create a program that was a more natural shift into learning and offered all the movement and play our kids still needed. Our child was finished with academic instruction every day by lunch and was soaring! I knew we were onto something...</p>
    <p>I believe in setting clear boundaries and expectations without raising my voice, and I allow children to learn to make safe choices on their own. Natural consequences are my preferred way to handle discipline. We will take responsible risks, make messes, practice using calm words to express wants and needs, work on self-reliance skills, make choices for ourselves, and explore our social/emotional skills through real-life conflict management.</p>
    <p>I look forward to working with your family, and I can’t wait to see this generation of kids grow up to change the world!</p>
